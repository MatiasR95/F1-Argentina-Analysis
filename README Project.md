# 🏎️ **F1 Argentina Data Analytics Project – Portfolio README**

## 📢 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the **performance of Argentine drivers in Formula 1**, with a special emphasis on **Franco Colapinto’s 2024 debut season**. As an Argentine and a passionate F1 fan, I was motivated by Colapinto’s entry into F1 after more than 15 years without Argentine representation. This project was a perfect opportunity to merge my love for motorsport with data analysis, allowing me to explore a topic that genuinely excites me while showcasing my SQL skills in a real-world scenario.

For the analysis, I used a **comprehensive Formula 1 dataset** sourced from Kaggle, which contains updated information for every season from **1950 to 2024**. The dataset’s relational structure—with tables covering drivers, races, results, constructors, and circuits—made it ideal for practicing various SQL concepts.  

🔎 **Key Objectives:**  
- Explore the historical performance of Argentine drivers in F1.  
- Compare Franco Colapinto’s debut season with those of other Argentine drivers.  
- Apply and demonstrate practical SQL data analysis skills.  
- Develop a recruiter-friendly project with clear, documented queries.  

💾 **Dataset:**  
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020  
- Contains data on races, drivers, constructors, results, circuits, and standings.  

🚀 **Deliverables:**  
- A complete set of **SQL queries** reflecting different data analysis stages.  
- Clear explanations of each query’s logic and purpose.  
- Visual summaries and insights (described in the project explanation).

## 📊 **Data Visualization with Tableau**  
To showcase the insights obtained from the SQL analysis, I created an **interactive Tableau dashboard** highlighting:
- Points progression of Argentine drivers over the decades.
- Franco Colapinto’s race results and performance comparison.
- Podium finishes and constructor associations with Argentine drivers.
- Trends in Argentine driver participation throughout F1 history.

🔗 **Tableau Dashboard Link:** *(Coming soon – will be added here when published)*

*Why use Tableau?* Visualizations make the data-driven stories clearer and more engaging, especially for non-technical stakeholders. This dashboard provides an interactive way to explore key metrics from the project.
